Module: XML::SAXDriver::CSV

Description:
    XML::SAXDriver::CSV provides a SAX interface to easily transform CSV documents into XML.  
    The module uses Text::CSV_XS to parse CSV files simultaneously write out XML data.  
    XML::SAXDriver::CSV allows to create your own Text::CSV_XS object with defaults that 
    fit your needs or just use defaults.  There will be more handlers added later (ex. DTD, etc...).  
    This module complements the XML::CSV module and should be used to provide a lightweight SAX
    interface which enhances performance and well as decreases the memory foot mark.
